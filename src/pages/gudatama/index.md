Twitter retweet bot in Ruby

<!-- end -->

At Simpleweb's internal hack weekend, I've built a Twitter retweet bot, which can be used as a tool for automatically retweeting any post by specific users or tagged on Twitter. I have been using it to automatically retweet any new post on my favourite anime character, Gudetama's timeline.
